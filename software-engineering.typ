= Systems modeling 

_"Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production"_ @sommerville2016software. 

\

In the following pages I'll focus on the most *important concepts* of the course. Those fundamental concepts will be treated in *great detail* to give a deep enough understanding of the material.

\

When designing *complex software* we have to make major *design choices* at the beginning of the project. Often those choices can't be driven by experience or reasoning alone, that's why a *model* of the project is needed to *simulate* and *compare* different solutions. Our formal tool of choice is the *Markov Chain* (treated in @dtmc).

  }, caption: "the 'traffic' system modeled with 2 subsystems") <traffic> 
]

== The concept of time

The models treated in the course evolve through *time*. Time can be modeled in many ways (I guess?), but, for the sake of simplicity, we will consider discrete time. Let $W$ be the _'weather system'_ and $D$ the _'driving ability' system _ in @traffic, we can define the evolution of $D$ as 

\

$ 
  & D(0) = "'good'" \
  & D(t + d) = f(D(t), W(t)) 
$

\

Given a time instant $t$ (let's suppose 12:32) and a time interval $d$ (1 minute), the driving ability of $D$ at 12:33 depends on the driving ability of $D$ at the time 12:32 and the weather at 12:32.

== Formal notation 

=== Markov Chain

A Markov Chain is...

=== DTMC (Discrete Time Markov Chain) <dtmc>

A DTMC $M$ is a tuple $(U, X, Y, p, g)$ s.t.
- $U != emptyset and X != emptyset and Y != emptyset$ _(otherwise stuff doesn't work)_
- $U$ can be either 
  - ${ u_1, ..., u_n }$ where $u_i$ is an input value 
  - ${()}$ if $M$ doesn't take any input
- $X = { x_1, ..., x_n }$ where $x_i$ is a state
- $Y = { y_1, ..., y_n }$ where $y_i$ is an output value
- $p : X times X times U -> [0, 1]$ is the transition function
- $g : X -> Y$ is the output function

\

$
  forall x in X space.en forall u in U space.en sum_(x' in X) p(x'|x, u) = 1
$

\

$
  & M(0) = x_1 \
  & M(t + d) = cases(
    x_1 quad & "with probability " p(x_1|M(t), U(t)) \
    x_2 quad & "with probability " p(x_2|M(t), U(t)) \
    ...
  )
$

\

It's interesting to notice that the transition function depends on the input values. If you consider the _'driving ability'_ system in @traffic, you can see that the probability to go from `good` to `bad` is higher if the weather is rainy and lower if it's sunny. 

#pagebreak()

=== An example of DTMC

Let's consider the development process of a team. We can define a DTMC $M = (U, X, Y, p, g)$ s.t.
- $U = {()}$, as it doesn't have any input
- $X = {0, 1, 2, 3}$ 
- $Y = "Cost" times "Duration (in months)"$

Now we have to put together our *formal definitions* and our `C++` knowledge to build some simple DTMCs and networks.

=== A simple Markov Chain

Let's begin our modeling journey by implementing a DTMC $M$ s.t. 
- $U = {()}$
- $X = [0,1] times [0,1]$
- $Y = [0,1] times [0,1]$
- $p : X times X times U -> X = cal(U)(0, 1) times cal(U)(0, 1)$ 
- $g : X -> Y : (r_0, r_1) |-> (r_0, r_1)$

// as the uniform continuous distribution (TODO) $cal(U)(0, 1)$, maybe better if something around $cal(U)(0, 1) times cal(U)(0, 1)$, not like that, but around there

// and we define 


// And we connect the DTMC to itself with

- $X(0) = (0, 0)$
// - $U = "Time" times RR$ 
// - $U(t + 1) = (t, r_1 + 1) "s.t." Y(t) = (r_0, r_1)$

\

    for (size_t time = 0; time <= HORIZON; time++)
        for (auto &r : state)
            r = uniform(random_engine);

    return 0;
}

//         output << std::endl;
//     }
//
//     output.close();
//
//     return 0;
// }
// ```

=== Connected Markov Chains

Now let's model a system with two DTMCs $M_0, M_1$, and lets define the functions

$U(M_0, t + 1) = dots.c$
$U(M_1, t + 1) = dots.c$
